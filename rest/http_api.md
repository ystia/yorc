# Yorc HTTP (REST) API

yorc runs an HTTP server that exposes an API in a restful manner.
Currently supported urls are:

## Deployments

Adding the 'pretty' url parameter to your requests allow to generate an indented json output.

### Submit a CSAR to deploy <a name="submit-csar"></a>

Creates a new deployment by uploading a CSAR. 'Content-Type' header should be set to 'application/zip'.

There are two ways to submit a new deployment, you can let yorc generate a unique deployment ID or you can specify it.

#### Auto-generated deployment ID

In this case you should use a `POST` method.

`POST /deployments`

#### Customized deployment ID

In this case you should use a `PUT` method. There are some constraints on submitting a deployment with a given ID:

* This ID should respect the following format: `^[-_0-9a-zA-Z]+$` and be less than 36 characters long (otherwise a `400 BadRequest` error is returned)
* If this ID  is already in use, the behavior depends on the Yorc version, premium or open source :
  * in the premium version, a deployment update will be performed as described in next section below,
  * in the open source version, a `409 Conflict` error is returned.

`PUT /deployments/<deployment_id>`

**Result**:

In both submission ways, a successfully submitted deployment will result in an HTTP status code 201 with a 'Location' header relative to the base URI indicating the task URI handling the deployment process.

```HTTP
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: /deployments/b5aed048-c6d5-4a41-b7ff-1dbdc62c03b0/tasks/b4144668-5ec8-41c0-8215-842661520147
Content-Length: 0
```

This endpoint produces no content except in case of error.

A critical note is that the deployment is proceeded asynchronously and a success only guarantees that the deployment is successfully
**submitted**.

### Update a deployment (premium feature) <a name="update-csar"></a>

Updates a deployment by uploading an updated CSAR. 'Content-Type' header should be set to 'application/zip'.

`PUT /deployments/<deployment_id>`

If the given ID doesn't correspond to the ID of an existing deployment, this call
won't perform an update, but will create a new deployment as described in the previous section.

**Result**:

A successfully submitted deployment update will result in an HTTP status code 200.
There won't be any 'Location' header relative to the base URI indicating a task URI
handling the update process, as the current implementation only supports the update
of Workflows, which is performed synchronously.

```HTTP
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 0
```

This endpoint produces no content except in case of error.
As the ability to update a deployment is a premium feature, attempting to perform
a deployment update using the open source version of Yorc will return the error `409 Conflict`.

### List deployments <a name="list-deps"></a>

Retrieves the list of deployments. 'Accept' header should be set to 'application/json'.

`GET /deployments`

**Response**:

```HTTP
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "deployments": [
    {
      "id": "deployment1",
      "status": "DEPLOYED",
      "links": [
        {
          "rel": "deployment",
          "href": "/deployments/deployment1",
          "type": "application/json"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Undeploy  an active deployment <a name="undeploy"></a>

Undeploy a deployment. By adding the optional 'purge' url parameter to your request you will suppress any reference to this deployment from the yorc database at the end of the undeployment. A successful call to this endpoint results in a HTTP status code 202 with a 'Location' header relative to the base URI indicating the task URI handling the undeployment process.
By adding the optional 'stopOnError' url parameter to your request, the un-deployment will stop at the first encountered error. Otherwise, it will continue until the end.

`DELETE /deployments/<deployment_id>[?purge]&[stopOnError]`

**Response**:

```HTTP
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Location: /deployments/b5aed048-c6d5-4a41-b7ff-1dbdc62c03b0/tasks/b4144668-5ec8-41c0-8215-842661520147
Content-Length: 0
```

This endpoint produces no content except in case of error.

A critical note is that the undeployment is proceeded asynchronously and a success only guarantees that the undeployment task is successfully
**submitted**.

### Get the deployment information <a name="dep-info"></a>

```

### List deployment events <a name="list-events"></a>

Retrieve a list of events. 'Accept' header should be set to 'application/json'.

There are two available endpoints, one allowing to retrieve the events for a given deployment, the other allowing to retrieve the events for all the known deployments.

These endpoints support long polling requests. Long polling is controlled by the `index` and `wait` query parameters.
`wait` allows to specify a polling maximum duration, this is limited to 10 minutes. If not set, the wait time defaults to 5 minutes.
This value can be specified in the form of "10s" or "5m" (i.e., 10 seconds or 5 minutes, respectively). `index` indicates that we are
polling for events newer that this index. A _0_ value will always returns with all currently known event (possibly none if none were
already published), a _1_ value will wait for at least one event.

#### List deployment events concerning a given deployment

`GET    /deployments/<deployment_id>/events?index=1&wait=5m`

#### List all the deployment events

`GET    /events?index=1&wait=5m`

#### Response

A critical note is that the return of these endpoints has no guarantee of new events. It is possible that the timeout was reached before
a new event was published.

Note that the latest index is returned in the JSON structure and as an HTTP Header called `X-yorc-Index`.

```HTTP
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
X-yorc-Index: 1812
```

```json
{
  "events": [
    {"timestamp":"2016-08-16T14:49:25.90310537+02:00","node":"Network","instance":"0","status":"started"},

}
```

### Get latest events index <a name="last-event-idx"></a>

You can retrieve the latest events `index` by using an HTTP `HEAD` request.

`HEAD    /deployments/<deployment_id>/events`

or

`HEAD    /events`

The latest index is returned as an HTTP Header called `X-yorc-Index`.

**Response**:

```HTTP
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-yorc-Index: 1812
```

### Get deployment logs <a name="list-logs"></a>

Retrieve a list of logs concerning deployments. 'Accept' header should be set to 'application/json'.

There are two available endpoints, one allowing to retrieve logs for a given deployment, the other allowing to retrieve the logs for all the known deployments.

These endpoints supports long polling requests. Long polling is controlled by the `index` and `wait` query parameters.
`wait` allows to specify a polling maximum duration, this is limited to 10 minutes. If not set, the wait time defaults to 5 minutes.
This value can be specified in the form of "10s" or "5m" (i.e., 10 seconds or 5 minutes, respectively). `index` indicates that we are
polling for events newer that this index. A _0_ value will always returns with all currently known logs (possibly none if none were
already published), a _1_ value will wait for at least one log.

On optional `filter` parameter allows to filters logs by type. Currently available filters are `engine` for yorc deployment logs,
`infrastructure`  for infrastructure provisioning logs and `software` for software provisioning logs. This parameter accepts a coma
separated list of values.

#### Get logs concerning a given deployment

`GET    /deployments/<deployment_id>/logs?index=1&wait=5m&filter=[software, engine, infrastructure]`

#### Get all the logs

`GET    /logs?index=1&wait=5m&filter=[software, engine, infrastructure]`

Note that the latest index is returned in the JSON structure and as an HTTP Header called `X-yorc-Index`.

**Response**:

### Execute a custom command <a name="custom-cmd-exec"></a>

Submit a custom command for a given deployment.

The command corresponds to an operation defined in a node type interface.
The operation is executed by default on all the node type instances.
It can also be applied to a selected subset of instances.
For that, the list of instance identifiers must provided in the request body.

'Content-Type' header should be set to 'application/json'.

`POST    /deployments/<deployment_id>/custom`

Request body allowing to execute command on all the node instances:

```json
{
    "node": "NodeName",
    "name": "Custom_Command_Name",
    "interface": "fully.qualified.interface.name",
    "inputs": {
      "index":"",
      "nb_replicas":"2"
    }
}
```

Request body allowing to execute command on some selected node instances:

```json
{
    "node": "NodeName",
    "name": "Custom_Command_Name",
    "interface": "fully.qualified.interface.name",
    "instances": [ "0", "1" ],
    "inputs": {
      "index":"",
      "nb_replicas":"2"
    }
}
```

**Response**:

```HTTP
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Content-Length: 0
Location: /deployments/08dc9a56-8161-4f54-876e-bb346f1bcc36/tasks/277b47aa-9c8c-4936-837e-39261237cec4
```

### Scale a node <a name="scale-node"></a>

Scales a node on a deployed deployment. A non-zero integer query parameter named `delta` is required and indicates the number of instances to
add or to remove for this scaling operation.

A critical note is that the scaling operation is proceeded asynchronously and a success only guarantees that the scaling operation is successfully
**submitted**.

`POST /deployments/<deployment_id>/scale/<node_name>?delta=<int32>`

A successfully submitted scaling operation will result in an HTTP status code 201 with a 'Location' header relative to the base URI indicating
the URI of the task handling this operation.

```HTTP
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: /deployments/b5aed048-c6d5-4a41-b7ff-1dbdc62c03b0/tasks/012906dc-7916-4529-89b8-fdf628838fe5
Content-Length: 0
```

This endpoint produces no content except in case of error.

This endpoint will failed with an error "400 Bad Request" if:

* another task is already running for this deployment
* the delta query parameter is missing
* the delta query parameter is not an integer or if it is equal to 0

### Execute a workflow <a name="workflow-exec"></a>

Submit a custom workflow for a given deployment.
By adding the optional 'continueOnError' url parameter to your request, 
workflow will not stop at the first encountered error and will run to its end.

By default the execution of the workflow's steps take place on all the instances of the workflow's nodes.
It is possible to select instances for the workflow's nodes by adding selection data in the request body.
For nodes that have no selected instances specified, the execution steps take place on all instances.

`POST /deployments/<deployment_id>/workflows/<workflow_name>[?continueOnError]`

Request body allowing to execute a workflow's steps on selected node instances :

```json
{
    "nodeinstances": [
       {
         "node": "Node_Name",
         "instances": [ "0", "2" ]
       }
    ]
}
```

A successfully submitted workflow result in an HTTP status code 201 with a 'Location' header relative to the base URI indicating
the URI of the task handling this workflow execution.

**Response**:

```HTTP
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Length: 0
Location: /deployments/08dc9a56-8161-4f54-876e-bb346f1bcc36/tasks/277b47aa-9c8c-4936-837e-39261237cec4
