Yorc is an hybrid cloud/HPC [TOSCA](http://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML/v1.2/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML-v1.2.html) orchestrator.

It aims to support the whole application lifecycle, from deployment, scaling, monitoring, self-healing, self-scaling to application upgrade, over hybrid infrastructures (IaaS, HPC schedulers, CaaS).

Yorc is TOSCA native to allow handling complex applications in a standard way. Yorc is also workflow-driven,
this means that it doesn't contain any hard-coded lifecycle logic. This allows to fully customize applications behavior and to execute custom workflows at runtime.

Yorc is designed for large-scale, it is built with a tasks / stateless workers model in mind allowing to scale it
horizontally easily.

Finally, while you can easily interact with Yorc directly thanks to its comprehensive REST API and a modern CLI,
the recommended way to use Yorc is to model your applications in a powerful TOSCA designer called [alien4cloud](https://alien4cloud.github.io) and to use it to deploy and interact with your application at runtime.
Yorc is now the official orchestrator for Alien4Cloud and Alien4Cloud distributions comes with a specific plugin for Yorc. Sources of this plugin could be found here <https://github.com/alien4cloud/alien4cloud-yorc-provider>
