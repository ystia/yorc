### BREAKING CHANGES

#### Refactor Yorc storage system

Yorc supports several store types and store implementations that can be configured by users correspondingly with their needs.
See below enhancement allowing to implement a File+Cache sorage backend.

#### Changes in Yorc metric namespace

In order to improve the observability of Yorc execution, the exposed metrics' names were modified.
Now labels are used which allow to provide metric trees ([GH-297](https://github.com/ystia/yorc/issues/297)).

#### Changes on the deployments API

As deployments are from now stored by JSON, some functions have been changed:

```
func GetOperationPathAndPrimaryImplementation(ctx context.Context, deploymentID, nodeTemplateImpl, nodeTypeImpl, operationName string) (string, string, error)
func GetRequirementsKeysByTypeForNode(ctx context.Context, deploymentID, nodeName, requirementType string) ([]string, error)
func GetRequirementKeyByNameForNode(ctx context.Context, deploymentID, nodeName, requirementName string) (string, error)
func ReadWorkflow(kv *api.KV, deploymentID, workflowName string) (tosca.Workflow, error)
```

And substituted by:

```
func GetOperationImplementation(ctx context.Context, ...) (*tosca.Implementation, error)
func GetRequirementsByTypeForNode(ctx context.Context, deploymentID, nodeName, requirementType string) ([]Requirement, error)
func GetWorkflow(ctx context.Context, deploymentID, workflowName string) (*tosca.Workflow, error)
```

## 4.0.0-M7 (November 29, 2019)

### BREAKING CHANGES

#### Changes in the REST API

##### Deployment updates

Until now deployments updates (which is a premium feature) were made on the same API operation than submitting a deployment with a given identifier:
`PUT /deployments/<deployment_id>`.
The decision on updating a deployment or creating a new one was based on the existence or not of a deployment with the given identifier.

This was confusing and makes error handling on clients difficult. So we decided to split those operations on two different API endpoints.
Submitting a deployment with a given identifier remain as it was, but updating a deployment is now available on the `PATCH /deployments/<deployment_id>` endpoint.

Trying to update a deployment on an OSS version will now result in a `401 Forbiden` error instead of a `409 Conflict` error previously.
Submitting a deployment with an identifier that is already used will still result in a `409 Conflict` error but without an informative message indicating that a
premium version is required to perform a deployment update.

This is tracked on ([GH-547: Refactor Deployment updates API](https://github.com/ystia/yorc/issues/547)).

* Loading bar while bootstrap ([GH-254](https://github.com/ystia/yorc/issues/254))

### ENHANCEMENTS

* Allow to specify query parameters in infrastructure usage queries ([GH-543](https://github.com/ystia/yorc/issues/543))

### BUG FIXES

### BUG FIXES

* YORC_LOCATIONS_FILE_PATH env variable and locations_file_path command flag are not working ([GH-535](https://github.com/ystia/yorc/issues/535))

## 4.0.0-M5 (October 11, 2019)

### BREAKING CHANGES

The support of locations in Yorc (issue [GH-478](https://github.com/ystia/yorc/issues/478)), provides the ability to create several locations of a given infrastructure type (Openstack, Google Cloud, AWS, SLURM, Hosts Pool).

It introduces breaking changes in Yorc configuration as described below.

It is not anymore possible to define infrastructure properties through:

* environment variables, like `YORC_INFRA_OPENSTACK_AUTH_URL`
* yorc server command flags, like `--infrastructure_openstack_auth_url`.

Yorc configuration file does not anymore contain infrastructures definitions. This configuration provides now the path to a file defining locations for any of these types: Openstack, Google Cloud, AWS, SLURM.

For example, this Yorc configuration file in previous version allowed to define a single infrastructure of type OpenStack:

```yaml
resources_prefix: yorc-
consul:
  address: http://consul-host:8500
  datacenter: dc1
infrastructures:
  openstack:
    auth_url: http://1.2.3.4:5000
    tenant_name: mytenant
    user_name: myuser
    password: mypasswd
    region: RegionOne
    private_network_name: private-net
    default_security_groups: [group1,default]
```

This becomes now in this version:

```yaml
resources_prefix: yorc-
consul:
  address: 127.0.0.1:8500
locations_file_path: /path/to/locations.yaml
```

And file `/path/to/locations.yaml` contains locations definitions, for example here two OpenStack locations :

```yaml
locations:
  - name: myFirstOpenStackLocation
    type: openstack
    properties:
      auth_url: http://1.2.3.4:5000
      tenant_name: mytenant
      user_name: myuser
      password: mypasswd
      region: RegionOne
      private_network_name: private-net
      default_security_groups: [group1,default]
  - name: mySecondOpenStackLocation
    type: openstack
    properties:
      auth_url: http://5.6.7.8:5000
      tenant_name: mytenant
      user_name: myuser
      password: mypasswd
      region: RegionOne
      private_network_name: private-net
      default_security_groups: [group1,default]
```

When a Yorc server is starting and has no location defined yet, it will read this locations configuration file and create the corresponding locations.
Once this has been done, the locations configuration file won't be used anymore. Next version of Yorc will provide CLI and APIs allowing to create/update/delete locations.

Regardings Hosts Pool, the file format allowing to define one Hosts Pool hasn't changed.
But the CLI commands have now a mandatory argument to provide the location name:  `-l locationName` or `--location locationName`.

For example, this command was executed in previous Yorc version to create/update a Hosts Pool from a file:

```bash
yorc hp apply myhostspool.yaml
```

It is now:

```bash
yorc hp apply -l myLocation myhostspool.yaml
```

See Yorc documentation for additional details:

* section [configuration](https://yorc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html)
* section on [CLI commands related to Hosts pool](https://yorc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html#cli-commands-related-to-hosts-pool)

## 3.0.0 (July 11, 2018)

### Naming & Open Source community

Yorc 3.0.0 is the first major version since we open-sourced the formerly known Janus project. Previous versions have been made available on GitHub.

We are still shifting some of our tooling like road maps and backlogs publicly available tools. The idea is to make project management clear and to open Yorc to external contributions.

### Shifting to Alien4Cloud 2.0

Alien4Cloud released recently a fantastic major release with new features leveraged by Yorc to deliver a great orchestration solution.

Among many features, the ones we will focus on below are:

* UI redesign: Alien4Cloud 2.0.0 includes various changes in UI in order to make it more consistent and easier to use.
* Topology modifiers: Alien4Cloud 2.0.0 allows to define modifiers that could be executed in various phases prior to the deployment. Those modifiers allow to transform a given TOSCA topology.

### New GCP infrastructure

We are really excited to announce our first support of [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/).

Yorc now natively supports [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/) to create compute on demand on GCE.

### New Hosts Pool infrastructure

Yorc 3.0.0 supports a new infrastructure that we called "Hosts Pool". It allows to register generic hosts into Yorc and let Yorc allocate them for deployments. These hosts can be anything, VMs, physical machines, containers, ... whatever as long as we can ssh into them for provisioning. Yorc exposes a REST API and a CLI that allow to manage the hosts pool, making it easy to integrate it with other tools.

For more informations about the Hosts Pool infrastructure, check out [our dedicated documentation](http://yorc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/infrastructures.html#hosts-pool).

### Slurm infrastructure

We made some improvements with our Slurm integration:

* We now support Slurm "features" (which are basically tags on nodes) and "constraints" syntax to allocate nodes. [Examples here](https://wiki.rc.usf.edu/index.php/SLURM_Using_Features_and_Constraints).
* Support of srun and sbatch commands (see Jobs scheduling below)

### Refactoring Kubernetes infrastructure support

In Yorc 2 we made a first experimental integration with Kubernetes. This support and associated TOSCA types are deprecated in Yorc 3.0. Instead we switched to [new TOSCA types defined collectively with Alien4Cloud](http://alien4cloud.github.io/#/documentation/2.0.0/orchestrators/kubernetes/kubernetes_walkthrough.html).

This new integration will allow to build complex Kubernetes topologies.

### Support of Alien4Cloud Services

[Alien4Cloud has a great feature called "Services"](http://alien4cloud.github.io/common/features.html#/documentation/2.0.0/concepts/services.html). It allows both to define part of an application to be exposed as a service so that it can be consumed by other applications, or to register an external service in Alien4Cloud to be exposed and consumed by applications.

This feature allows to build new use cases like cross-infrastructure deployments or shared services among many others.

We are very excited to support it!

### Operations on orchestrator's host

Yet another super interesting feature! Until now TOSCA components handled by Yorc were designed to be hosted on a compute (whatever it was) that means that component's life-cycle scripts were executed on the provisioned compute. This feature allows to design components that will not necessary be hosted on a compute, and if not, life-cycle scripts are executed on the Yorc's host.

This opens a wide range of new use cases. You can for instance implement new computes implementations in pure TOSCA by calling cloud-providers CLI tools or interact with external services

Icing on the cake, for security reasons those executions are by default sand-boxed into containers to protect the host from mistakes and malicious usages.

### Jobs scheduling

This release brings a tech preview support of jobs scheduling. It allows to design workloads made of Jobs that could interact with each other and with other "standard" TOSCA component within an application. We worked hard together with the Alien4Cloud team to extent TOSCA to support Jobs scheduling.

In this release we mainly focused on the integration with Slurm for supporting this feature (but we are also working on Kubernetes for the next release :smile:). Bellow are new supported TOSCA types and implementations:

* SlurmJobs: will lead to issuing a srun command with a given executable file.
* SlurmBatch: will lead to issuing a sbatch command with a given batch file and associated executables
* Singularity integration: allows to execute a Singularity container instead of an executable file.

### Mutual SSL auth between Alien & Yorc

Alien4Cloud and Yorc can now mutually authenticate themselves with TLS certificates.

### New Logs formating

We constantly try to improve feedback returned to our users about runtime execution. In this release we are publishing logs with more context on the node/instance/operation/interface to which the log relates to.

### Monitoring

Yorc 3.0 brings foundations on applicative monitoring, it allows to monitor compute liveness at a interval defined by the user. When a compute goes down or up we use or events API to notify the user and Alien4Cloud to monitor an application visually within the runtime view.

Our monitoring implementation was designed to be a fault-tolerant service.
