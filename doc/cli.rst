Janus Command Line Interface
============================

You can interact with a Janus server using a command line interface (CLI). The same binary as for running a Janus server is used for the CLI.

General Options
---------------

  * ``--janus-api``: Specifies the host and port used to join the Janus' REST API. Defaults to ``localhost:8800``. Configuration entry ``janus_api`` and env var ``JANUS_API`` may also be used.
  * ``--no-color``: Disable coloring output (By default coloring is enable). 
  * ``-s`` or ``--secured``: Use HTTPS to connect to the Janus REST API
  * ``--ca-file``: This provides a file path to a PEM-encoded certificate authority. This implies the use of HTTPS to connect to the Janus REST API.
  * ``--skip-tls-verify``: skip-tls-verify controls whether a client verifies the server's certificate chain and host name. If set to true, TLS accepts any certificate presented by the server and any host name in that certificate. In this mode, TLS is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. This should be used only for testing. This implies the use of HTTPS to connect to the Janus REST API.

CLI Commands related to deployments
-----------------------------------

All deployments related commands are sub-commands of a command named ``deployments``. 
In practice that means that the commands starts with 

.. code-block:: bash
    
    janus deployments

For brevity ``deployments`` supports the following aliases: ``depls``, ``depl``, ``deps``, ``dep`` and ``d``.

Deploy a CSAR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Deploys a file or directory pointed by <csar_path>
If <csar_path> point to a valid zip archive it is submitted to Janus as it.
If <csar_path> point to a file or directory it is zipped before beeing submitted to Janus.
If <csar_path> point to a single file it should be TOSCA YAML description.

.. code-block:: bash

     janus deployments deploy <csar_path> [flags]
     
Flags:
  * ``--id``: Specify a id for this deployment. This id should not already exists, should respect the following format: ``^[-_0-9a-zA-Z]+$`` and should be less than 36 characters long (Optional otherwise a unique ID is generated by Janus) 
  * ``-e``, ``--stream-events``: Stream events after deploying the CSAR.
  * ``-l``, ``--stream-logs``: Stream logs after deploying the CSAR. In this mode logs can't be filtered, to use this feature see the "log" command.

  * ``-e``, ``--stream-events``: Stream events after deploying the CSAR.
